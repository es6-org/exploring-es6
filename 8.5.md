## 8.5 FAQ: 模板字面量和标签化模板

### 8.5.1 模板字面量和标签化模板源于哪里？

模板字面量和标签化模板是借用自语言E，它称这个特性为 quasi literals 。

### 8.5.2 What is the difference between macros and tagged templates?

Macros allow you to implement constructs that have custom syntax. Providing macros for a language whose syntax is as complex as JavaScript’s is difficult and ongoing research (see Mozilla’s sweet.js).

While macros are much more powerful for implementing sub-languages than tagged templates, they depend on the tokenization of the language. Therefore, tagged templates are complementary, because they specialize on text content.

### 8.5.3 Can I load a template literal from an external source?

What if I want to load a template literal such as `Hello ${name}!` from an external source (e.g., a file)?

Note that you are abusing this mechanism if you do so. Given that a template literal can contain arbitrary expressions and is a literal, loading it from somehwere else is similar to loading an expression or a string literal – you have to use eval() or something similar.

Coming back to the example, this is how you’d do it:

```javascript
let str = '`Hello ${name}!`'; // external source

let func = new Function('name', str);

let name = 'Jane';
let result = func(name);
```

Every variable that isn’t declared inside the template literal has to become a parameter of the function func that we are creating. Alternatively, you could load a whole function and eval it1:

```javascript
let str = '(name) => `Hello ${name}!`'; // external source

let func = eval.call(null, str); // indirect eval

let name = 'Jane';
let result = func(name);
```

### 8.5.4 Why are backticks the delimiters for template literals and tagged templates?

The backtick was one of the few ASCII characters that were still unused. The syntax ${} for interpolation is the de-facto standard (Unix shells, etc.).

### 8.5.5 Weren’t tagged templates once called template strings?

The template literal terminology changed relatively late during the creation of the ES6 spec. The following are the old terms:

- Template string (literal): the previous name for template literal.
- Tagged template string (literal): the previous name for tagged template.
- Template handler: the previous name for tag function.
- Literal section: the previous name for template string (the term substitution remains the same).
